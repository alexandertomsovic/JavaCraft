# JavaCraft! Version V2.0 has finally finished!

Hello all! I am importing my JavaCraft V2.0 game to my github! JavaCraft V1 and JavaCraft V2 were previously on replit. Visit that here: linktr.ee/alextomsovic

The controls are simple and explained in the game. 
Here are the basics for movement:

- L left
- R right
- J jump
- C craft

- BR break right block
- BL break left block
- BD break down block
- BU break up block

- PR place right block
- PL place left block
- PD place down block
- PU place up block

Here are the updates introduced into JavaCraft V2

Ores - this is the biggest change. We've now got coal, rubies, and emeralds!

Crafting - obviously, with different ores, you can't mine all of them right from the start. I've added crafting, and for the reason in the next addition.

Pickaxes! You start with the fist pickaxe, and can upgrade through crafting to better ones which can mine better ores.

That's it! This was quite a long project! I hope you enjoy and have fun!
